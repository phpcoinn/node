# What is PHPcoin?

PHPcoin is a cryptocurrency built with PHP, designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and accessible to a wide range of users. It is a full-featured blockchain implementation that can be used for various purposes, from simple transactions to more complex decentralized applications (Dapps).

The project's primary goal is to provide a simple and stable cryptocurrency that can be easily understood, modified, and deployed. This makes it an excellent choice for developers who want to learn about blockchain technology or build their own custom blockchain solutions.

PHPcoin is an open-source project, and its code is publicly available for anyone to review, use, or contribute to.
