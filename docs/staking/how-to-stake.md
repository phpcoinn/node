# How to Stake

Staking is the process of holding PHPcoin in a wallet to support the operations of the blockchain network. In return for staking, you receive rewards in the form of new PHPcoin.

## How Staking Works

PHPcoin uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which means that anyone who holds PHPcoin can participate in the process of creating new blocks and validating transactions.

To be eligible for staking rewards, you need to meet the following requirements:

*   **Minimum Balance:** You must have a minimum balance of PHPcoin in your wallet. You can check the current minimum balance by calling the `/api.php?q=nodeInfo` API endpoint.
*   **Maturity:** Your coins must have reached a certain maturity, which means they must have been held in your wallet for a certain number of blocks. You can check the current maturity requirement by calling the `/api.php?q=nodeInfo` API endpoint.

If you meet these requirements, your wallet will automatically be entered into a lottery to create the next block. If your wallet is chosen, you will receive a reward in the form of new PHPcoin.

## How to Start Staking

To start staking, you simply need to hold PHPcoin in your wallet. There is no need to perform any special actions or run any special software.

As long as your wallet is running and connected to the network, you will be eligible to receive staking rewards.
