# Features

PHPcoin comes with a wide range of features that make it a powerful and flexible cryptocurrency platform. Here are some of its key features:

*   **Proof-of-Work Consensus:** PHPcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to secure its network. This is the same algorithm used by Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies.

*   **Web-Based and Command-Line Mining:** You can mine PHPcoin using either a web-based interface or a command-line miner, providing flexibility for different types of users.

*   **Masternodes:** PHPcoin supports masternodes, which are special nodes that provide additional services to the network and earn rewards for their owners.

*   **Decentralized Applications (Dapps):** The platform is designed to support Dapps, allowing developers to build and deploy their own decentralized applications on the PHPcoin blockchain.

*   **Web Interface:** PHPcoin includes a user-friendly web interface that provides access to a block explorer, wallet, and other tools.

*   **API:** A comprehensive API is available for developers who want to build applications that interact with the PHPcoin blockchain.

*   **Open Source:** PHPcoin is an open-source project, which means its code is publicly available for anyone to review, use, or contribute to.
